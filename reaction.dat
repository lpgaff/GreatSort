## Reaction definition
#BeamA: 30		# mass number
#BeamZ: 12		# atomic number
#BeamE: 8500.	# the laboratory beam energy in keV/u (note, not the usual MeV/u)
#TargetA: 2		#
#TargetZ: 1		#  
#EjectileA: 1	# in (d,p) the ejectile is the proton
#EjectileZ: 1	# we keep this language even though we have inverse kinematics
#RecoilA: 31	# the recoil is the heavy ion
#RecoilZ: 12	# not the target-like product as in normal kinematics
